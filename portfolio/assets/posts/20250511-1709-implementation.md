how it works | _2025-05-11 17:09_
________
since no web framework was used, i had to figure out how to automate the gallery without listing each image manually in the html.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
each gallery block on a page has a class that indicates its folder (e.g. portraits, automotive, streets). on page load, the js script reads this class, fetches a corresponding json file, and builds the gallery from it.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
the json file is generated by a php script that scans the relevant image folder and outputs the filenames. this script runs whenever a page is accessed, so all i need to do is drop the image into the folder, and it shows up.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
the pictures are not related to the post, they're just there to test fancybox implementation galleries in blog posts.
