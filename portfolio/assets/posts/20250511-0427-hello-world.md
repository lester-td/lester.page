i never really considered putting a blog here. but i thought it'd be useful.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
my thoughts will probably live here, or anything related to photography that images can't quite explain :-)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
currently i am migrating my portfolio from wordpress to a handwritten solution using html, css, js and php. it all started when i got frustrated trying to wrestle with the block editor. this site is somewhat functional now, but it's still a constant work in progress.
